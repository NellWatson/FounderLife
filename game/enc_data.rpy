 stereotypethreat = "Stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group    (Steele & Aronson, 1995). This term was first used by Steele and Aronson (1995) who showed in several experiments that Black college freshmen and sophomores performed more poorly on standardized tests than White students when their race was emphasized. When race was not emphasized, however, Black students performed better and equivalently with White students. The results showed that performance in academic contexts can be harmed by the awareness that one's behavior might be viewed through the lens of racial stereotypes."
 burnout = "Burnout motivation centres in the brain. 3 types of burnout exhaustion (emotional and physical), motivational burnout, boreout meaninglessness:"
 autonomy = "Autonomy, Mastery and Control."
 flexbility = "When small business owners try to stick to a 9 to 5 workday, the results can be disastrous. It’s always going to be more of a give-and-take rather than a regimented schedule,” Overell said. “Owners need to be able to respond to crises and crunch times, but they also need to be able to let go and actually leave the office when they can. Warren describes this dynamic as a sequence of ebbs and flows. The reality is that balance is out of my control, she said. Working hard is inevitable. To address symptoms of overwork before bad habits start to form, Warren encourages business owners to focus on the aspects of their schedules they can actually control, rather than letting their schedules control them. For small business owners, work never stops. That doesn’t mean that downtime will never happen—it just happens on the business’s schedule, not your own."
 exercise = "Don’t be afraid to experiment with your lifestyle in trying to find opportunities to relax,” Overell said. “One of our cofounders takes a long early morning walk every day and another one goes on an intensive meditation retreat every [year]. Our head of growth recently cut her hours and upped her workouts in order to be more productive at work."
 Motivation = "Split tasks I split my time between tasks so that I can relax in between,” she said. If I am writing a blog post from 9:00-10:30am, then from 10:30am-11am I’ll check emails, or go grab a coffee. Warren looks for subtle hacks to help her stay focused without becoming exhausted or bored. I’ll never tackle the same type of task one after the other. It never fares well, she said. This allows me recoup and actually restart my thoughts when I get to the next task."
 Patience = "Don’t let long-term ambition cloud your short-term judgment. Building a business takes years, not days. Warren stressed that it’s important for business owners to set realistic goals and expectations. You will have ups and downs. Just make sure to take a long-term view. Look at your milestones in terms of years. In addition to defining what you want to accomplish, make sure to have a bigger vision for why. Keeping your work in context is crucial for sustaining mental energy, both for you and your team."
 curiosity = "Openness to new experiences is an important aspect of entrepreneurship, and indeed, to a life well-lived."
 Confidence = "If diffident describes you well, there's a good chance you're an over-thinker with a lot of negative self-talk rolling around in your head.Pay attention to what you're saying to yourself. Every time you think something like I cant do this replace it with something positive such as Im going to give it my best shot. The key is to step out of yourself and look at your self-talk as an outsider. How would it make you feel to hear someone sitting next to you say Im so \[fat, dumb, ugly, slow, etc.\]? Pretty harsh, right? Nurture yourself within your thought life, just as you might with someone else."
 confidencesmile = "Some people are naturally more serious than others. If this is you, learn to smile and laugh more. Even a simple grin will suffice to entice others to want to be around you. To make smiling a habit, set a time when you'll practice doing it for several minutes straight--maybe in the car on your way to work. It will seem weird, but after a while smiling will come more naturally. Studies have also shown that forcing yourself to smile is good for your health, as well."
 confidenceslouch = "Regardless of your confidence level, slouching communicates you lack faith in yourself. Try posting a note on the edge of your computer display with a reminder such as an up arrow in thick red marker or the words SIT UP STRAIGHT. To correct yourself, roll your shoulders back and imagine someone just pulled a string from the top of your head, elongating your spine and raising your chin so it's in a neutral, forward-facing position."
 confidenceotherpeople = "Self-conscious people worry too much about what others think about them. The thing is, usually other people aren't thinking about them--at all. Imagine you had the magical power to read the thoughts of the people around you. You know what you'd hear a lot of? Stuff like this: Crap, I forgot to stop by the bank... I shouldn't have eaten that cake Susan brought to work, now I feel fat... I hope Sara flirts with me again tonight at volleyball like she did last week... Why should I have to clean the downstairs bathroom when Bill is the only one in the house who uses it?"
 resilience = "Robustness is not just being tough, withstanding an offensive. It's about [i]rolling[/i] with those punches, being able to thrive in uncertainty, and be invigroated by it. Ship Often, bootstrap everything, and learn to live on scraps. Create products and deals with an unlimited payoff or upside. Invest in skills, diversify your assets."
 assetcreation = "A waged job pays once per transactional block of time or effort. An asset has unlimited upside - a stream of revenue. In transitioning from a wage-based income, your goal should be to create small, diverse and easy-to-build assets thats can be rapidly deployed, and rapidly improved. This is the surest path to financial freedom."

 positivecognitivedistortions2 = "Personal Exceptionalism\n\nDefinition - a macro sense that you are in the top of your cohort, your work is snowflake-special, or that you are destined to have experiences well outside the bounds of \"normal\;\" not to be confused with arrogance or high self- esteem\n\nBenefit - resilience, stamina, charisma\n\nDeadly risk - assuming macro-exceptionalism means micro-exceptionalism, brittleness"

 positivecognitivedistortions5 = "Blank-Canvas Thinking\n\nDefinition - sees own life as a blank canvas, not a paint- by-numbers\n\nBenefits - no sense of coloring outside the lines, creates surprises\n\nDeadly risk - \"Ars gratia artis,\" failure to launch, failure to scale"
